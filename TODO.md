    [ ] local keypress for enter
    [ ] inter process communication
[ ] show running task in open toolbar
[ ] dropdown of existing tasks fuzzy search select them
[ ] show list of tasks in toolbar with amount of time spent on them
[ ] clean up code and deploy finished version

[ ] search tasks in toolbar and play pause them

# ISSUES:
- cannot do open toolbar via hotkey due to api not giving coordinates of the toolbar..
